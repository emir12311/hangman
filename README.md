# Hangman 😵𓍯  

I made this as my **third Python project**, coding mostly in short breaks between classes, lunch, and a longer session at home.  
It’s a text-based Hangman game with categories and simple stickman ASCII art.  

## How the game works  
1. The program picks a random **category**: Food, Items, or Animals.  
2. Then it picks a random word from that category.  
3. You start with 6 lives (for the 6 stages of Hangman).  
4. You can guess one letter at a time or try the whole word.  
5. Wrong guesses cost a life, and the stickman ASCII art updates.  
6. The game ends when you guess the word or lose all your lives.  

## What I learned while making it  
- Using **lists** to track progress and guessed letters.  
- Loops and conditionals to control the game flow.  
- Basic ASCII art.  
- Working with files to save scores.  

### Note 📝  
Like my other projects, this is the **first version only**.  
I’m not improving or rewriting it unless it’s a really special project.  
This GitHub is meant to show my growth over time, from my earliest code to whatever I make in the future.
